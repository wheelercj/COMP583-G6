## dev environment setup

1. Navigate to where you want the project's folder to appear.
2. Download the code with `git clone https://github.com/wheelercj/COMP583-G6.git`.
3. Download the dependencies with `npm install`.
4. If you want to be able to run the web server locally for testing, you will need to create a MySQL database and a `.env` file in the project's root with these environment variables: `DB_HOST`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_USER`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PORT`, and `DB_SSL`. 

Now you should be able to use `node server.js` to run the server!
