7. For pointing Nginx to a Node.js server, I compared a bunch of guides (below) and picked the parts that kind of made sense.

8. `cd ~`
9. Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/wheelercj/COMP583-G6.git`.
10. `npm install`
11. `vim .env`
12. Copy the contents of the local .env file to the new remote one.
13. Change the port Nginx directs requests to from 3000 to 3306
14. `sudo service nginx restart`
15. `sudo nginx -t` (not `nginx -t` since root permissions are needed) to test the configuration
16. [How To Deploy Node.js Applications Using Systemd and Nginx](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-node-js-applications-using-systemd-and-nginx)
    * I named the service `/etc/systemd/system/url-shortener.service`
    * I used my own linux user and group instead of creating a new one for the service
    * the `[Service]` section of the `url-shortener.service` file requires `EnvironmentFile=` followed by the path to the `.env`
